<h1>Sieve - Clean Teams notifications!</h1>

This app is made for Security Hackathon for MS 2024 under the challenge "Hack for boosting engineering productivity".

Sieve allows to filter notifications from Teams app on the basis of sender name, group name and/or the presence of certain keywords in the received message on Teams. Utilizes the Notification Listener Service to read notification data and then dismiss it or let it through, based on the words matched.


Code written in hassle, please avoid any bad patterns/practices followed in this project :D
